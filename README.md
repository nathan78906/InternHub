# InternHub
### The Idea behind InternHub
We wanted to create a universal job board for co-op students, interns, and employers. InternHub was an idea to simplify the job searching process for students, and simplify the job recruitment process for employers. We wanted one website where all students could look for jobs and employers could post jobs, rather than having to look for/post jobs on multiple university career websites and external job boards
